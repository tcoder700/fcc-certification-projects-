                Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>
            <p>

                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>
            <p>

                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
                developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
                be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There
                are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
                while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>

            <p>These are the things that you should know before starting to learn web development</p>
            <ol>
                <li>knowing the difference between front-end development and back-end development. You’ll end up knowing
                    a bit of both, but most specialise in one or the other. As for how to decide which way to go:
                    back-end handles the ins and outs of data (where you’re more likely to run into things like
                    algorithms, if you enjoy maths and logics), while front-end presents them in a user-friendly and
                    creative way (if you like UI/design/3d animations…)</li>

                <li>Just like with any other programming job, it's more about problem solving than it is about non-stop
                    code generation. Take front-end development as an example: more than anything else you'll find
                    yourself struggling with all kinds of weird compatibility issues, because unlike IOS/Android
                    development, something working on one platform never ever equals to it working on all (let's not
                    talk about IE the evil). It could be confusing and frustrating at first, but this part gets better
                    with experience. However even with experience you'll still run into all kinds of weird issues daily
                    anyway, so if you enjoy solving problems you'll likely enjoy web-development.</li>

                <li>Things move fast with web-development. Really fast. With ECMAScript standards changing, browsers
                    updating, tools and frameworks going in and out of style... It's a never-ending journey of new
                    knowledge absorbing. Which doesn't necessarily mean you'll need to learn them all, but it does
                    require curiosity and an open mind about learning new things.</li>

                <li>And something on the actual learning part I wish someone had told me two years ago:

                    <p>When you start, you'll be tempted to spend days or even weeks going through the list of all HTML
                        tags/attributes, CSS properties and jQuery functions, take notes and try reciting them before
                        you do anything else... Don't. For one thing, it's overwhelmingly scary how much you seemingly
                        need to remember to do the job. For another, it's only psychologically satisfying since you seem
                        to have done a lot of work (same with video watching), but it doesn't really yield much effect
                        to go through details in the beginning--you'll likely forget the parameter and the detailed
                        usage of a specific function in days.</p>
                </li>
                <li>you can follow all the above things mentioned and be determined to learn web development,Happy
                    learning!</li>

                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web
                browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
                developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark
                up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make
                content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider
                the following line of text:
                <code><p>My cat is very grumpy</p></code>this piece of text can be italicised or could be highlited or
                in other words marked using the various tags provided in HTML.

                Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. While
                HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it
                out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it
                into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

                This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should
                definitely start with the first one.

                CSS first steps
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font,
                color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
                decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the
                basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
                HTML.</p>

            <h4> CSS building blocks</h4>
            <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language
                and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This module
                looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling
                backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.

                The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
                essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.</p>

            <h4> Styling text</h4>
            <p>
                With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling
                text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
                including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and other text
                features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists
                and links.</p><code>text can be <em>italicised</em> like this</code>

            <h4>CSS layout</h4>
            <p>
                At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and
                manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in
                the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary
                prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern
                layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still
                want to know about.For example to create a flexbox we can use this code:<br>
                <code>display:flexbox; <br>width:100%;</code>
            </p>

            <h5> here are a few examples of code that can be used to design a web page</h5>
            <code>
      header{<br>
      font-family:ariel;<br>
      background-color:red;<br>
      color:white;<br>
      display:flex;<br>
      width:100%<br>
      }</code>
            <p>this would enable the user to customize the CSS of the header as he wishes</p>

            <p>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:<br>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code><br>

                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                are not explicitly typed</p>
