            <h2>Hear what financial sector leaders have to say about investments in mutual funds.</h2>
            <p>The chairman of the world bank on 21november,2021 said in a press conference that more than 102mn
                americans invest in mutual funds for financial security and as a safe invesmtent</p>
            <h4>Benefits of investing in mutual funds</h4>
            <p>Mutual fund is a financial instrument which pools the money of different people and invests them in
                different financial securities like stocks, bonds etc. Each investor in a mutual fund scheme owns units
                of the fund, which represents a portion of the holdings of the scheme.</p>
            <h4>Save Tax, and seek to great wealth</h4>
            <p>Indians have historically favoured traditional fixed income instruments for their investments (normal as
                well as tax savings). This, however, does not marry well in terms of prudent financial planning,
                especially since the country has one of the largest young population in the world. Indeed, the median
                age of Indiaâ€™s population is far below those of the most comparable economies as well as the world,
                which means most Indians have a long vesting period of investment.</p>
            <h4>Equity mutual funds in the new era</h4>
            <p>With the introduction of a 10% tax on long-term capital gains and dividends, equity-oriented mutual funds
                will feel the pinch as their returns will now be reduced to some extent. However, investors should not
                feel demotivated because equities still remain efficient as compared to other asset classes in the long
                term.Equity savings fund essentially generate returns by investing in equity, debt and arbitrage
                opportunities. This last component sets them apart from other hybrid funds. Essentially, the fund
                manager looks to exploit the pricing inefficiencies in the cash and derivatives segments of the equity
                market.</p>

            <h4>Open-End Management Investment(MUTUAL FUNDS)</h4>
            <p>With the introduction of a 10% tax on long-term capital gains and dividends, equity-oriented mutual funds
                will feel the pinch as their returns will now be reduced to some extent. However, investors should not

            <h4>Investment Bankers</h4>
            <p>Strategists advise external as well as internal clients on the strategies that can be adopted in various
                markets. Ranging from derivatives to specific industries, strategists place companies and industries in
                a quantitative framework with full consideration of the macroeconomic scene. This strategy often affects
                the way the firm will operate in the market, the direction it would like to take in terms of its
                proprietary and flow positions, the suggestions salespersons give to clients, as well as the way
                structurers create new products.</p>
            <h4>Portfolio Manager</h4>
            <p>A portfolio manager holds great influence on a fund, no matter if that fund is a closed or open mutual
                fund, hedge fund, venture capital fund or exchange-traded fund. The manager of the fund's portfolio will
                directly affect the overall returns of the fund. Portfolio managers are thus usually experienced
                investors, brokers, or traders, with strong backgrounds in financial management and track records of
                sustained success.f the portfolio manager is active, then the ability to have original investment
                insight is paramount. With over 7,000 active funds to choose from, active investors need to be smart
                about where they look. If the manager takes a passive approach, the originating insight comes in the
                form of the market index they've decided to mirror. Passive managers must make smart choices about the
                index.</p>
